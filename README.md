## The Traffic Data (TTD)
 ##Capstone II from thinkful
 
 Have you ever had to commute somewhere less than 5 miles but takes 30 mins to travel there?
 Do you hate being in traffic? 
 Would ever want to see where the most traffic happens so you can avoid that area?
 
 I present to you The Traffic Data
  - This is version 1.0, since I only had the time to get the heatmap and traffic data up and running
  - There will be a users/admin signup and log in page in the near future
  -TDD gives you a heatmap of what areas have the most traffic
    -Key:
     -Red: The most in the area
     -Yellow: Not so bad
     -Green: No traffic
  
## Languages used
   -React
   -Node
   -Knex
   -PostgreSQL
   
## Future Updates
  - Time constraints didnt give me a chance to test the Endpoint or components
  - App needs to have a landing page
  - Implement JWT to have admin and user credentials to log in
